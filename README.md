A JGame version of Color Sheep. Baa!

Color Sheep is a puzzle game. Help Sir Woolson defend himself from the evil wolves!

The goal of the game is to destroy all the wolves within each level by matching Woolson’s ability to shoot a colored laser beam from his mouth to the color of the wolf.

Woolson’s powers are based off of a additive color model (think colored combinations of lights). Woolson can shoot red, green and blue colored lasers, but he must decide whether these are light or dark colors first. Combining these colors will result in other colors, for example: light red and light blue make light magenta. In order to prevent a wolf from creeping too close to him (and consequentially eating him and destroying his castle), Woolson must mix and match his colors and match the colors of the incoming wolves invading his home.
